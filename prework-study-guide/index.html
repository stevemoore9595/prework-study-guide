        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li>It is made up of elements that work together to provide the content and basic framework for all the pages on the web.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements within the head aren't visible to the user looking at that webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element contains the content that is seen by the user, and all the elements we want the user to see must be placed inside this element. </li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE html is a declaration to tell the browser what type of document is being opened.</li>
          <li>The meta charset elements sets our character encoding.</li>
          <li>The meta http-equiv element sets an HHTP header for content.</li>
          <li>The meta viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
          <li>We use HTML first to build a sturdy frame.</li>
        </ul>

        <section class="card" id="css-section">

          <h2>CSS</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>CSS is what makes the style of the website.</li>
        <li>After create a sturdy frame with HTML, we us CSS to create the style.</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They’re useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
        <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
        <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are totally acceptable methods under certain conditions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>

        <ul>
  
          <li>git status: checks what branch you are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git checkout branch-name: switch to another branch</li>
          <li>git add -A: used to stage the changes and commit all files in the current branch</li>
          <li>git commit -m: used to commit the changes and -m is used to associate the message with the commit</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

      <ul>

        <li>JavaScript makes the website interactive, and this is added after styling the webpage with CSS.</li>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        <li>function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
        <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Just like its name sounds, when using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
        <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
        <li>The for loop is used often to repeat a task over and over again and iterate over an array with only a few lines of code.</li>
