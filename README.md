# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created to help me during the prework and boot camp courses. It contains information about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. This will be a great tool for me because it will help me remember definitions and how to use certain codes. One thing that I have learned in these lessons is how to use the CLI. I have gotten stuck a few times and had to do some debugging to get myself back on course. I think it was good for me because it gave me more practice to figure out what I did wrong and what I need to do to fix it.

## Usage

Answers for questions about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript can be found on the Prework Study Guide homepage. This is  information that I learned in the prework. If you are new to coding I would recommend learning about HTML first, because that is the frame of the website. To see what is happening, please feel free to open the Console for more information and to see that JavaScript is running.
